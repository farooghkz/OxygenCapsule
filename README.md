Oxygen Capsule
==============
When you want to go diving underwater, use these capsules to increase your
breath up to 10.
This mod currently contains a small capsule(in three state: empty, half and
full)  and a capsule filler, each full capsule can increase your breath to 10.

I said *small* capsule because bigger one may be added later(how about a big
one attached to player?)

## It's not ready!
It need textures(three for capsules and one or two for capsule filler), my
painting and drawing was never good, I draw something randomly but it needs
some real textures, it won't be usable till it doesn't have textures.

If you want to draw textures, remember they are capsules full of gas, not
a glass with water.

Also I don't have any idea about its fuel/power source, I wanted to use mesecons but I think it's silly to make it working just using a torch. currently it works without any fuel/power.

## Crafting
 - s = steel ingot
 - c = empty capsule
 - e = empty
Empty Capsule:
```
 e s e
 s e s
 e s e
```
Capsule filler:
```
 s s s
 s c s
 s s s
```

## Usage
 - Craft an Empty Capsule and a Capsule filler.
 - Put the Empty Capsule in Capsule filler, after 10 seconds it will turn to
   half capsule and after another 10 seconds, you will have a full Capsule.
 - Go deep underwater, each time you use it, it will increase your breath by
   10\. you can use it twice, once it will convert to half capsule and another
   time to an empty one.
 - Return it to capsule filler for later usage.
