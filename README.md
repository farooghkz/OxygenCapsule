Oxygen Capsule
==============
When you want to go diving underwater, use these capsules to increase your
breath up to 10.
This mod currently contains a small capsule(in three state: empty, half and
full) and an Oxygen compressor. Each full capsule can increase your breath to 10.

I said *small* capsules because bigger ones would be added later(how about a big
one attached to player?)

## It's not ready!
It needs textures. My
painting and drawing was never good. I have drawn something randomly but it needs
some real textures and it won't be really usable till it doesn't have textures.

If you want to draw textures, remember they are capsules full of gas, not
a glass with water.

## Crafting
 - s = steel ingot
 - c = empty capsule
 - e = empty

Empty Capsule:
```
 e s e
 s e s
 e s e
```
Oxygen Compressor:
```
 s s s
 s c s
 s s s
```

## Usage
 - Craft an Empty Capsule and an Oxygen compressor.
 - Get some oil extracts(say 99)
 - Put oil extracts in fuel slot of the compressor
 - Put the Empty Capsule in Oxygen Compressor(in one of 2x2 slots which is for
   capsules), after 10 seconds it will turn to
   half capsule and after another 10 seconds, you will have a full Capsule.
 - Dive deep underwater. each time using it will increase your breath by
   5 and you can use it twice, once it will convert to half capsule and another
   time to an empty one.
 - Return it to Oxygen compressor for later usage.
